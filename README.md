# Workshop Monitor

A Java 17 application that monitors when Merlin's has new workshops and notifies you by **email** when:

- New **Loul√©** or **Albufeira** workshops appear.

The app stores "seen" items in JSON file in the filesystem to avoid sending duplicate notifications.

The app is designed for a specific Qualtrics form structure and it extracts information according to it.

The app can run in single or scheduled mode. The initial trigger was to run this in scheduled mode in a lower power consumption device like a Raspberry Pi.
